## What it is
- Auto mounts TrevorNAS if available
- If TrevorNAS is mounted to the mount point (`/Volumes/home`) then it auto syncs files as defined in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ryanhoulihan.backuptoNAS.plist`
- Uses `rsync` to sync files efficiently, preserving links and metadata.
- Logs all activity to `~/Library/Logs/nasbackup.log`, including start/end times, per-pair results, and rsync output.
- Prevents multiple concurrent runs with a lockfile (`/tmp/nasbackup.lock`).
- Provides CLI tool through `backup_to_nas`

## Launch Agent
Wrote a launch agent  `mountNAS` to mount the NAS and `backuptoNAS` which checks if the NAS volume is mounted and if so runs rsync.

**Start Launch Agent**
```bash
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ryanhoulihan.mountNAS.plist
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ryanhoulihan.backuptoNAS.plist
```
**Stop Launch Agent**
```bash
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ryanhoulihan.mountNAS.plist
	launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ryanhoulihan.backuptoNAS.plist
```
